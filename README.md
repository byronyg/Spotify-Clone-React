# My-Music
A Typescript React web music player based on the Spotify web API

As a good way to learn [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and improve my [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) knowledge, I am building a web based music player and using the RESTful [Spotify web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) for data.

The music player should look like the design above (source: dribbble) and a user should perform operations including: 
1.  Play music
2.  Search music by title or artist
3.  View albums
4.  View playlist
5.  Login
6.  Toggle between dark and light mode.
